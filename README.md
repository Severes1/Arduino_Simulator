Installation - Windows
-----------------

Make sure you have the [Java jdk](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) installed.

Open the run_simulator.bat file in notepad. The second line of text should say: 

```set PATH="```**YourPathNameHere**```";%PATH%```

Replace the text in the quotes with the location of the *bin* file where you installed the Java jdk. For example:

```set PATH="C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_25\bin";%PATH%```

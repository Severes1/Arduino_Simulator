Arduino_Simulator
=================

*For the Hopkins Robotics Club*

Installation - Windows
-----------------

Make sure you have the [Java jdk](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) installed.

Open the run_simulator.bat file in notepad by right clicking on it and pressing "Edit". The second line of text should say: 

```set PATH="```**YourPathNameHere**```";%PATH%```

Replace the text in the quotes with the location of the *bin* file where you installed the Java jdk. For example:

```set PATH="C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_25\bin";%PATH%```

Make sure to save it, then exit notepad.

Running a Program
------------------
Double-click the run_simulator file. It will ask you press Tab until you see the name of the program you want to run. Press enter to run the program you have selected.

Creating a new Program or Modifying an Old One
--------------------
You can edit the arduino programs in any text editor. Either download [Arduino](http://arduino.cc/en/main/software) or use something like Wordpad or Notepad++.

To create a new program, open the *arduino* folder and double click the **Create New Program** file. It will ask you to name your program. The new program will be placed in a folder with the same name.
